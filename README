BAKTALK
A simpler, self hostable alternative to Discord.

Steps to set it up:
 - Install Docker on your system
 - Add api/.env file with a single line that begins with "TOKEN_SECRET=" and whatever token secret following it that you want your instance to use (it's recommended to be long)
 - Edit the corsOrigin field in api/constants/config.json to match your web address (the beginning of whatever url the browser's address bar will display)
 - Edit client/src/baktalk-core/constants/config.json to match the API's availability
 - Enter api/scripts directory, then run ./build.sh followed by ./run.sh
 - Repeat the last step, but first enter the client/scripts directory instead
 - If this is going to be a public instance, it's recommended to use https and a reverse proxy, like nginx

Enjoy chatting with your friends :)
